This site is going to be for my driving school. I'm building this static site because I'm fed up with malware getting into my site by the means of the wp database or plugins. And it's now costing me a small fortune to keep it clean. So in about six months time I want my site on github to be up and running under my already existing RijschoolThomas.com domain.
